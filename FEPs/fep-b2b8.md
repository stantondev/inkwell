# FEP-b2b8: Long-form Text


## Summary

Multi-paragraph text is an important content type on the Social Web. This FEP defines best practices for representing and using properties of a long-form text object in [Activity Streams 2.0][AS2].

## Motivation

Blog posts, magazine articles, and forum posts are often made up of multiple paragraphs of text, sometimes with embedded images, video, audio or other media. This important content type is documented in the [Activity Vocabulary], but this FEP provides additional guidance for publishers and consumers and collects the relevant properties in one place.

Well-defined behaviour for supporting long-form text provides multiple benefits. Not only does it allow publishers to integrate content in a dependable way across different platforms, but it also gives users of Activity Streams 2.0 consumer applications more control over their reading experience -- including filtering or sorting long-form text objects in their stream.

This FEP does not provide guidance for book-length or longer text.

This document provides information for multiple protocols that use Activity Streams 2.0 as a representation format. Where [ActivityPub] use is different than AS2, it is noted.

Because long-form text is often syndicated using [RSS 2.0][RSS2], the properties in this FEP are compared to the properties in that format where appropriate.

## Type

The [Article](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-article) type is used to represent multi-paragraph text. The Activity Streams 2.0 primer provides [guidance](https://w3.org/wiki/Activity_Streams/Primer/Article_and_Note) on when to use the `Article` type and when to use the `Note` type.

Some consumers do not display `Article` objects with their full content. Some publishers work around this by using a `Note`-type object with much more content than expected for a note.

Publishers should avoid this workaround, and instead give consumers the full information they need to display the content correctly in their own interfaces. The [preview](#preview) property can be used to provide a simpler version of the content for consumers that don't support `Article` directly.

Forcing long-form text into a `Note` object can cause problems for consumers that expect `Note` objects to be short and well-formatted for stream display. Maintaining a clear distinction between `Note` and `Article` objects is important for interoperability.

Consumers that only display short text should show the `name`, `summary` and a link to the `url` property so that users can view the full content in a web browser. As a fallback, they can use the `preview` property if it is present.

## Properties

### `id`

A unique identifier for the text. For ActivityPub, this should be an HTTPS URL that resolves to the object. It should be a single string, unique for all objects.

This property provides the same functionality as the `guid` property in RSS 2.0.

### `name`

The title of the text should be in the `name` property. The property should be short enough to be displayed in a line or two on a browser interface; 75-150 characters is a good rule of thumb. Longer descriptions should be in the `summary` property.

The `name` property should be plain text, not HTML or other markup. In particular, no HTML entities like `&amp;` or `&lt;` should be used.

This property provides the same functionality as the `title` property in RSS 2.0.

### `url`

The location of the full text should be in the `url` property. This can be a single string, in which case it is the URL of the HTML representation of the text. It can also be a [Link](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-link) object, which can include additional metadata about the link. If it is a `Link` object, the `mediaType` should be 'text/html' and `href` property should be the URL of the HTML representation of the text.

The `url` property can also be an array of strings or `Link` objects or both. Multiple `Link` objects can be used to represent different media types or provide different URL protocols. At least one of the `Link` objects should have a `mediaType` of 'text/html' and a `href` property with the protocol 'https'.

This property provides the same functionality as the `link` property in RSS 2.0.

### `summary`

This property provides a brief description, teaser, abstract or "lede" for the text. It should be a maximum of about 500 characters; a few sentences; or a short paragraph.

This property can include HTML markup. It should not include embedded media like images, video or audio. It should not include navigation or interaction elements like "favourite", "like", "bookmark" or other buttons. It should not include links to the publisher's home page or category pages. It should not include a "Read more..." link to the full text.

This property provides the same functionality as the `description` property in RSS 2.0.


### `attributedTo`

This property provides the authors of the text, either as a string, an object, or an array.

As a string, it is a single `id` for the author. For ActivityPub, the `id` should be a URL that resolves to an ActivityPub [actor](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#actor-objects).

As an object, it can be an AS2 object with a type like `Person`, `Application` or `Organization`. It should have an `id` and a `name` property and can also include an `icon` property for the author's avatar. A `summary` property can be used to provide a brief description of the author, including HTML. An `url` property can be used to provide a link to the author's profile page.

If the author does not have an AS2 representation, the `attributedTo` property can be an object with a `type` of `Link` and an `href` property with the URL of the author's profile page. The `name` property can be used to provide the author's name.

As an array, the `attributedTo` property can include multiple authors, either as strings or objects.

The `attributedTo` property provides the same functionality as the `author` property of an item in RSS 2.0, with additional features.

### `published`

The publication date of the text should be in the [published](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-published) property. This should be a [dateTime](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-datetime) string in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.

This property provides the same functionality as the `pubDate` property in RSS 2.0.

### `updated`

If the object has been updated, the date of the last update should be in the [updated](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-updated) property. This should be a [dateTime](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-datetime) string in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. If the property is not present, consumers can assume that the object has not been modified since the `published` date.

### `image`

The [image](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-image) property provides a notable or representative image for the text. It can be included by reference as an `id` or with an `Image` type object.

There can be multiple values for the `image` property, either as an array of `id` strings or `Image` objects. Publishers should provide these in order of importance, with the most important image first. Consumers can use as many or as few as needed.

### `content`

The full text of the article or blog post should be in the [content](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-content) property. This should be HTML. Using `mediaType` to set a different media type presumes that consumers will be able to display that type.

The HTML elements in the `content` property should include a sanitized subset of
the full HTML element set. It should not include any CSS or JavaScript. This subset should include:

- `<p>`
- `<span>` (class)
- `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- `<br>`
- `<a>` (href, rel, class)
- `<del>`
- `<pre>`
- `<code>`
- `<em>`
- `<strong>`
- `<b>`
- `<i>`
- `<u>`
- `<ul>`
- `<ol>` (start, reversed)
- `<li>` (value)
- `<blockquote>`
- `<img>` (src, alt, title, width, height, class)
- `<video>` (src, controls, loop, poster, width, height, class)
- `<audio>` (src, controls, loop, class)
- `<source>` (src, type)
- `<ruby>`
- `<rt>`
- `<rp>`

The HTML should only include the content of the text. Additional navigation to other pages on the originating site, like category links or home page links, should not be included. Other affordances like "favourite", "like", "bookmark" or other buttons should not be included. It should not include a "Read more..." link to the full article.

Any embedded media like images, video or audio in the `content` property should also be listed in the `attachment` property so that consumers can pre-fetch the media.

### `source`

If the text was originally created in a different format, the original source should be in the [source](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-source) property to allow editing the content. It should include the `mediaType` of the source format and the `content` property with the original content.

### `replies`

Comments on the text should be linked in the [replies](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-replies) property. This should be a URL that resolves to a collection of objects for the replies.

Comments are usually `Note` objects, but can be other types of objects like `Article` or `Question`.

This property provides the same functionality as the `comments` property in RSS 2.0.

### `inReplyTo`

If the text is a reply to another ActivityPub object, such as an `Article` or `Note`, the `inReplyTo` property can include a string with the URL of the object being replied to, or a JSON object representing that object.

If the text is a commentary on or review of a particular link on the Web, the `inReplyTo` property can include a `Link` object with a `href` property that is the URL of the linked resource.

### `attachment`

The [attachment](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-attachment) property provides additional media that is part of the text. This can include images, video, audio, or other media. Consumers can use this property to pre-fetch media for display without needing to load and parse the full `content` property.

### `tag`

The [tag](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-tag) property provides additional metadata about the text. There are two important types of tags:

- [Hashtag](https://swicg.github.io/miscellany/#Hashtag) objects, which represent a topic or category that the text is about. These should have a `name` property with the tag text.
- [Mention](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-mention) objects, which represent a mention of an actor, such as an ActivityPub actor. These should have an `href` property with the URL of the actor's profile page.

### `context`

If the text is part of a larger collection, the [context](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-context) property can provide a link to the collection. An example might be an article in a series, a newspaper column, a blog category (although `tag` may be better here) or a section of a magazine.

There can be multiple `context` properties, either as an array of strings or objects or both.

### `generator`

The [generator](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-generator) property provides information about the software that generated the text. This is usually an `Application` or `Service` object with an `id` and a `name` property.

### `preview`

In AS2, the `preview` property provides an abbreviated version of the content of the object. Especially for microblogging applications, the `preview` property is a useful fallback for supporting unrecognized object types like `Article`.

For an article, the `preview` can be a `Note` that gives a well-formatted preview of the article content in its `content` property. For example, the `name` and `summary`. The preview content SHOULD NOT include a link to the HTML representation for the article. Additional navigation to other pages on the originating site, like category links, home page links, and other affordances like "favourite", "like", "bookmark" or other buttons should not be included.

The `content` property of the `preview` should include a minimal set of HTML elements, as described in [ActivityPub Primer HTML](https://www.w3.org/wiki/ActivityPub/Primer/HTML).

Metadata on the `Article` that applies equally to the preview, such as `attributedTo`, `published`, `updated`, and `tag` can be repeated in the `preview` property. The consumer should fall back to the `Article` properties if they are not present in the `preview`.

The `image` property of the `Article` may be included in the `preview` property as `attachment` items.

The `preview` property may have an `id` property.

### `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `bto`, `audience`

As with other AS2 object types, the `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `bto`, and `audience` properties identify the addressees of the text. For ActivityPub, they also determine the delivery targets of the text.

The addressing properties provide an access control mechanism for AS2. Publishers and consumers should not disclose the properties of any AS2 object type, including the `Article` type, with anyone except the addressees, listed in these addressing properties, or the creator(s), listed in the `attributedTo` property.

### `sensitive`

[sensitive](https://swicg.github.io/miscellany/#sensitive) marks an article as potentially sensitive, controversial, or disturbing in the author's opinion. As a non-exhaustive list and depending on context, nudity, sexual activity, violence, or spoilers for a movie or book may be considered sensitive.

If the sensitive flag is set, the consumer should obscure the content of the article until the user conveys intent to read the article or view embedded media.

To help the user decide whether to read the article or view its media, the consumer should show these properties, if provided, in order:

- [`dcterms:subject`](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject): a property from the [Dublin Core metadata terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/). Value should be a string or array of strings indicating the topic or topics discussed in the article.
- `tag`: in particular, `Hashtag` names. (`subject` is preferred because hashtags are often less human-readable).
- `name`: as described above, the title of the `Article`. Authors are more likely to leak sensitive material in the title, so the subject and/or hashtags should be used first.
- `summary`: as described above. Only as a last resort when other properties are not defined; a well-written summary is likely to include significant excerpts or summation of the sensitive content.

## User interface guidance

Consumers should use their native interfaces to handle `Article` objects in an intuitive way that integrates well with other object types. The following illustrations provide examples of how `Article` objects might be displayed in a stream-oriented social web interface, such as a microblogging application. The UI elements are labelled with the properties of the `Article` object that most likely correspond to them.

### In stream, with image

An example of a long-form text object with an `image` property displayed in a social stream.
